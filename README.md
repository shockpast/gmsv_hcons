[gmsv_hcons](https://github.com/shockpast/gmsv_hcons) unifies features from other modules (such as [gm_enginespew](https://github.com/Metastruct/gm_enginespew) or [gm_hush](https://github.com/Synkstar/gmsv_hush)), to make it *unified*~, but also, we are trying to find ways, to implement their/own features much better that it was earlier.
